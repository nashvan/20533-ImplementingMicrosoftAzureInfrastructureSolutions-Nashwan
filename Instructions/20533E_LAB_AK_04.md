21. On the 20533E0401-ilb blade, click **Overview**. In the **Essentials** section, you should be able to identify the public IP address assigned to the load balancer. Note that at this point, you will not be able to connect to the two virtual machines in the backend pool, because they are not running a web server and the connectivity is additionally restricted by default network security group settings and the operating system-level firewall. You will change these settings later in this lab.


#### Task 3: Install and configure IIS on Azure VMs by using DSC and Windows PowerShell
  
1. On MIA-CL1, click **Start**, in the Start menu, expand the **Windows PowerShell** folder, right-click **Windows PowerShell ISE**, click **More**, and then click **Run as administrator**. When prompted by User Account Control for confirmation, click **Yes**.

2. In the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) window, open the **IISInstall.ps1** file located in F:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\Starter folder.

3. Review the content of the file. Note that this is a DSC configuration that controls the installation of the Windows Server Web-Server role. 

4. In the Windows PowerShell ISE window, open the **F:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\Starter\\Deploy-20533E0401DSC.ps1** file.

5. Review the content of the script. Note the variables that it uses, including the storage account and its key. The script first retrieves the storage account from the resource group, and then publishes the DSC configuration defined in the **Install.ps1** into it, placing it in the default DSC container named **windows-powershell-dsc**, stores the resulting module URL in a variable, and then sets the Azure Agent VM DSC extension on two virtual machines deployed by the provisioning script by referencing that URL. The script generates a shared access signature token that provides read only access to the blob representing the DSC configuration archive. 

7. Start the execution of the script. When prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your subscription. Wait until the script completes.

8. Switch to the Azure portal in the Microsoft Edge window.

9. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click ellipsis to the right of the **20533E0401-vm0** entry and click **Connect**.

10. On the **Connect to virtual machine** blade, click **Download RDP File**. When prompted, click **Open**.

11. If a Remote Desktop Connection warning message displays, select **Don't ask me again for connections to this computer**, and then click **Connect**. 

12. In the Windows Security dialog box, type the following credentials, and then click **OK**:

  - User name: **Student**

  - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

12. If another Remote Desktop Message displays, select the **Don't ask me again for connections to this computer** checkbox, and then click **Yes**.

13. If prompted in the Remote Desktop session whether to allow your PC to be discoverable, click **No**.

14. After you establish a Remote Desktop session to the VM, wait for the Server Manager window to open. In the Server Manager window, verify that **IIS** appears in the left pane, indicating that the Web Server (IIS) server role is installed.

15. Repeat steps 9 through 14 for the other virtual machine **20533E0401-vm1**.

16. After completing the tasks, switch back to your lab computer MIA-CL1. Leave both Remote Desktop sessions open.



#### Task 4: Test the DSC configuration and virtual machine availability
  
1. On MIA-CL1, in Microsoft Edge, in the Azure portal, in the hub menu, click **Resource groups**.

2. On the Resource groups blade, click **20533E0401-LabRG**.

3. On the 20533E0401-LabRG blade, in the list of resources, click **20533E0401-web-nsg**. This will open the corresponding blade.

4. On the 20533E0401-web-nsg network security group blade, click **Inbound security rules**.

5. Click **Add**.

6. On the Add inbound security rule blade, ensure that **Basic** appears in the upper left corner, and specify the following settings:

  - Source: **Any**

  - Source port ranges: **\***

  - Destination: **Any**

  - Destination port ranges: **80**

  - Protocol: **TCP**

  - Action: **Allow**

  - Priority: **1100**

  - Name: **allow-http**

7. Click **OK**.

8. Navigate back to the 20533E0401-LabRG blade.

9. On the 20533E0401-LabRG blade, in the list of resources, click **20533E0401-ilb**, representing the load balancer.

10. On the 20533E0401-ilb blade, note the value of its **Public IP address** entry.

11. Open a new InPrivate Microsoft Edge window, in the navigation bar, type **http://** followed by the IP address that you noted in the previous step, and then press the **Enter** key.

12. Verify that you can access the default IIS webpage.

13. Switch to the Remote Desktop session on **20533E0401-vm0**. In the **Server Manager** window, click **Tools** and, in the drop down menu, click  **Services**.

14. In the **Services** window, scroll down to the **World Wide Web Publishing Service** entry, right click on it, and click **Stop** in the right-click menu.

15. Switch to the Remote Desktop session on **20533E0401-vm1**. In the **Server Manager** window, click **Tools** and, in the drop down menu, click  **Services**.

16. In the **Services** window, scroll down to the **World Wide Web Publishing Service** entry, right click on it, and click **Stop** in the right-click menu.

17. Switch back to MIA-CL1. From MIA-CL1, refresh the InPrivate Microsoft Edge window. 

18. Verify that the **Hmm, we can't reach this page** message appears.

19. Switch back to the **Services** window the Remote Desktop session on 20533E0401-vm0.

20. In the **Services** window, right-click the **World Wide Web Publishing Service** entry, and then click **Start** in the right-click menu.

21. Once the service is running, switch back to MIA-CL1 and refresh the InPrivate Microsoft Edge window. Verify that you can again access the default IIS webpage. Note that you might need to wait about a minute after you start the **World Wide Web Publishing Service** service.

> **Note:** Optionally you can repeat this sequence, but this time stopping the **World Wide Web Publishing Service** on 20533E0401-vm0 and starting it on 20533E0401-vm1. As long as the service is running on at least one of the two virtual machines, you should be able to access the webpage.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created and configured a load balancer in front of two Azure VMs in the same availability set and implemented DSC-based configuration on these VMs.
