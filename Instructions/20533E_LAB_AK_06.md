6. In the script pane, type **`Set-Location -Path 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy'`** and then press the **F5** key.

6. In the console pane, type **`.\AzCopy /?`** and then press Enter.

7. Scroll through the syntax information displayed in the console pane. 


#### Task 3: Use AzCopy to upload blobs
  
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the script pane, type:

  ```
  .\AzCopy.exe /Dest:https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/asset-images /destkey:<access-key> /Source:F:\Labfiles\Lab06\Starter\asset-images
  ```

2. Switch to the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, scroll back to the blade for your storage account, and click **Access keys**.

3. On the access keys blade, click the **Click to copy** icon next to **Storage account name**. If prompted to allow access to Clipboard, click **Allow access**.

4. Switch to the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window and replace the **`<storage-account-name>`** entry with the content of Clipboard.

5. Switch to the Microsoft Edge window and, on the access keys blade, click the **Click to copy** icon next to **key1**. 

6. Switch to the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window and replace the **`<access-key>`** entry with the content of Clipboard.

7. Press the **F5** key to execute the command in the script pane.

> **Note**: If you execute the command and it fails, make note of the error message and the directory in which the journal files are located.  Temporary data files are put into the journal file folder with the default path **"%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy"** and need to be deleted before running the command again.

8. Examine the output in the console pane and verify that the content of the **F:\\Labfiles\\Lab06\\Starter\\asset-images** folder was copied to the Azure Storage account container **asset-images**.

9. In the Azure portal, on the storage account blade, click **Overview**.

10. In the **Services** section of the blade, click the **Blobs** tile.

11. On the **Blob service** blade, click the **asset-images** container.

12. On the **asset-images** blade, verify that there are six new blobs.

> **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have created a new Azure storage account with a container named **asset-images** and copied files from your local computer to that container by using the **AzCopy** utility.


## Exercise 2: Using Azure File storage
  
#### Task 1: Create a file share and upload files
  
1. Switch to the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window.

2. In the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE), in the console pane, type the following cmdlet and then press Enter:

  ```
  Add-AzureRmAccount
  ```

3. In the sign-in windows that appears, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

4. If you have multiple subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, to identify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```

5. Note the value of the **`Id`** property for each subscription in the output of the previous command. To specify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following commands, and then press Enter (replace **`SubscriptionId`** with the actual SubscriptionId property of that subscription):

  ```
  Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId 'SubscriptionId'
  ```

6. Click **File**, and then click **Open**.

7. In the **Open** dialog box, browse to F:\\Labfiles\\Lab06\\Starter\\, click **New-20533E06FileShare.ps1**, and then click **Open**.

8. In the script pane, in the **$storageAccountName** variable declaration at the beginning, replace the **`<storage-account-name>`** value with the name of the Azure storage account that you created in the previous exercise.

9. Review the script, noting that it:

  - Sets the values of variables named **$shareName** and **$directoryName** for the file share and the directory to create in the Azure Storage account
	
  - Uses the **Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey** cmdlet to retrieve the access key for your storage account.

  - Uses the **New-AzureStorageContext** cmdlet to create a security context for connections to the target storage account based on the key you retrieved

  - Uses the **New-AzureStorageShare** cmdlet to create an Azure Storage account file share

  - Uses the **New-AzureStorageDirectory** cmdlet to create a directory in the share

  - Sets the location of the folder hosting source files to be copied to the Azure Storage file share directory

  - Loops through the files in the source folder and uses the **Set-AzureStorageFileContent** cmdlet to copy each of them the folder in the Azure file share.

10. Save the script and then press the **F5** key.

11. Observe the script as it runs, and then view the output. When you finish, close Windows PowerShell ISE.



#### Task 2: Access a file share from an Azure VM

  ```
  Get-ChildItem -Path 'Z:\invoices'
  ```

22. Verify that invoice documents are listed.

23. Close the Windows PowerShell ISE window and Internet Explorer, and then sign out of the Remote Desktop session to 20533E0601-vm1.
